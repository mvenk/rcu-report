I am tremendously grateful to my advisor, Professor Eddie Kohler for
his continued guidance, support and ideas. His eye for detail, grace and relevance made working with him a
privilege. This project was a learning curve for me, and Professor Eddie has supported me
through his feedback and insight all along the way.\\

Rohit Kumar contributed equally to this project. This work reflects his energy and inputs. I've learned from his organized way of working, knack for automation, eye for elegance and brutally honest feedback.\\

I am indebted to my parents and sister for their unconditional loving support.
